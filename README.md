# Starter Code: To-Do-List Application (Intro to Python)
This repository contains code from the live-lesson covering the module project (To-Do-List Application) for the Intro to Python module.
<br>It also contains some additional coding examples that should be helpful to you when you attempt to complete this project.

## File Structure
The ``/examples`` folder just contains some basic examples about how to work with lists in Python.
<br>The ``to_do_list.py`` file is where the starter code is for your to-do-list application.

## Reminders / Hints
Remember to implement the ``view_task()`` and ``delete_task()`` functions.
Remember to implement error handling with ``try`` ``except`` blocks, as described in your project instructions.

Hint #1: For ``view_task()`` look at the ``looping_through_lists.py`` file for examples on how you could implement this.
<br>Hint #2: For ``delete_task()`` look at the ``deleting_items_by_index.py`` file for an example on how you could implement this. <b><i>(Recommended)</b></i> 
<br><br>You can also look at ``deleting_items_from_a_list.py`` for additional approaches.
